# Unveiling 70 Mathematical Concepts with Python: A Practical Guide to Exploring Mathematics Through Python

Heavily inspired by the works of Seymour Papert (mathematician and pioneer of educational technologies, former professor at MIT), the objective of this book is to demystify major mathematical ideas by equipping readers with the best tool to understand and play with them: programming.

Each mathematical concept or idea is presented in a double-page format, juxtaposing a detailed explanation of the concept with historical and epistemological context, and its illustration through Python code.

Numerous concepts are explored: prime numbers, pi, Pascal's triangle, differentiable programming, neural networks, kd trees, Newton's second law, finite elements, Euler's identity, and much more.
